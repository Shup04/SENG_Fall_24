    - **Layer 0:** Hardware
    - **Layer N:** User interface
    - **Advantages:** Modularity, ease of debugging and enhancement.
- **Microkernel Structure:**
    - **Example:** Mach
    - **Characteristics:** Minimalist kernel that performs only essential functions, with other services running in user space.
- **Modules:**
    - **Characteristics:** Modular approach, where the kernel has core functionality, and additional functionalities are provided by dynamically loaded modules.

#### 22. **Task Example**

- **Scenario:** A user navigates to a specific folder using a Windows interface with a command-line UNIX shell.
    - **System Calls Involved:** Get the folder name, locate the folder, and change to that folder.
    - **System Programs Involved:** Navigation can be done via mouse (Windows interface) or through the command-line shell.

#### 23. **Microkernel System Structure**

- **Definition:** Moves as many functions as possible from the kernel into user space.
