dispatch latency.

What is the default action of a parent process when a child process terminates?
Collect the exit status of the child process.

Which of the following scheduling algorithms is most suitable for scheduling threads in a real-time system?
Priority scheduling.

Rate Monotonic Scheduling is generally not suitable for soft real-time systems.
False.

In FCFS, the turnaround time of a process is always proportional to its burst time.
False.

In a round-robin scheduling algorithm, how does the CPU scheduler handle CPU and I/O bursts?
All processes are given equal time slices, alternating between CPU bursts and I/O bursts.

What happens to a process when it completes a CPU burst?
It enters an I/O burst and waits for I/O completion.

Which of the following is true about preemptive scheduling?
A process can be interrupted and moved to the ready queue if a higher-priority process arrives.

In shared memory IPC, the communication is under the control of the operating system.
False.

When fork() is invoked in a multithreaded program to duplicate only the calling thread, what potential issues may arise?
Inconsistent states.

Cooperating process cannot be affected by the execution of another process.
False.

The One-to-One multithreading model allows:
Better parallelism since multiple threads can run on multiple processors
